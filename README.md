# Evaluating Model Accuracy and Time Efficiency for Price Predictions on Online Second-hand Retail Markets
This project is a part of the final project for UC Davis [STA 141C - Big Data & High Performance Statistical Computing](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/expanded-descriptions/141C) in Spring Quarter 2019. 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

### Data Source
This project is inspired by the Kaggle's [Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercari-price-suggestion-challenge). We also obtained data from this competition.

### Methods Used
* Principal Component Analysis
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python

## Project Description
In this project, we want to use machine learning models to evaluate a given itemâ€™s conditions and features in order to make a price suggestion for sellers on an online second-hand shopping market. We compared prediction accuracy and time efficiency for different models, including linear regression model, Lasso, KNN, and random forest. We were able to achieve an error rate (measured by MSE) at 0.6072. Through the project, we also explored variables that are important in predicting prices.
